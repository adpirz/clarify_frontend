## Query Bounds

For MVP level, we want to limit the search to work the following way

### Group

Select only **one** member of any of the following groups:

- Student
- Section
- Grade-Level
- Whole School

I.E., you can only select one student, one section, one grade-level, or one school. You _cannot_ select multiple students, multiple sections, a student and a section, etc.  The table returned should comprise the data of ONE group.  That group will include a list of students, but we want to make sure they all fall under the same umbrella.

### Category

- Attendance
- Grades

### Time

- YTD
